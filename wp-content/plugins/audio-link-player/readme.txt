The Audio Link Player adds flash mp3 players to all your mp3 links.

== Description ==

This plug-in converts all your mp3 links in flash players. The usage is as easy as add a link to a post or page.

The plug-in differentiates between mp3 links in floating texts, mp3 links as images and mp3 links in lists or on single lines. For every situation the plug-in decides which is the best player solution and include it in your blog.

= Requirements =
* **Audio Link Player requires PHP5.2!**
* WordPress 3.0 or higher

= Settings =
You can change the association settings in WP Admin Panel &raquo; Settings &raquo; Audio Link Player.

= Handling =
The handling is very easy. Just add a link to a mp3 file in your post or page. The rest will be done by the plug-in. Of course you can also *link images* with mp3 files. These links will be converted to players which show the image and a play-icon in the middle of the image like you maybe know from video players. Give it a try! ;)

= Single Line Player =
You can overwrite the text inside the player by set a title for the mp3 link.

= Info for Designers =
The <object> tags of the players get the following classes: "inline-player", "single-line-player" and "image-link-player". And every player has the class "audio-link-player".
